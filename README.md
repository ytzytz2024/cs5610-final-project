# SmartRecipe (Iteration 1)

SmartRecipe is a responsive web application for recipe management built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). This repository contains the initial implementation (Iteration 1) of the application.

## Implemented Features

### Frontend
- 📱 **Responsive UI:** Adapts to desktop, tablet, and mobile screens
- 🏠 **Homepage:** Features a "What's in your kitchen?" component for ingredient input
- 🔍 **Search Interface:** Search page with sorting options (using mock data)
- 📝 **Recipe Creation Form:** Form for adding new recipes with validation
- 👤 **User Profiles:** Display of created and saved recipes with tabs
- 🍽️ **Recipe Detail View:** Detailed recipe view with ingredients, instructions, and reviews
- 🔐 **Authentication UI:** Login and registration pages

- 📊 **Project Configuration:** Package management, gitignore setup

## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React 19.0.0
- React Router DOM 7.3.0
- Bootstrap 5.3.3
- Axios for API calls
- Vite as build tool

### Backend
- Node.js with Express
- MongoDB with Mongoose (models defined)
- JWT structure for authentication
- Multer for file upload (structure only)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14.0.0 or later)
- npm (v6.0.0 or later)
- MongoDB (local or Atlas connection)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SmartRecipe.git
cd SmartRecipe
```

2. Install dependencies for both server and client
```
npm run install-all
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the server directory with:
```
PORT=5001
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

### Running the Application

To run both the server and client concurrently in development mode:
```
npm run dev
```

To run only the server:
```
npm run server
```

To run only the client:
```
npm run client
```

## Notes for Iteration 1

This is the first iteration of the SmartRecipe application focusing on UI implementation and project structure. Key points about the current state:

- UI components and pages are implemented with mock data
- Database models are defined but not fully connected
- Authentication is simulated with localStorage (not fully implemented)
- API routes are structured but minimally implemented
